# onchain-summer-hack-project
This project includes code source for project building on Base (L2) for onchain summer hackathon


## Thoughts & Ideas:
1. Onchain Company management, where it manages employees while paying salaries and providing successfull documents while leaving company (problem it solves: using EAS can verify employee career experience, company fake/real, company paymemts on Base and etc)
2. Base Realty, a real estate platform can be build on Base with EAS by utilising ERC-6055(under review: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6065) for successful engagement an NFT created from Nouns (problem it solves: make real estate easy by base by avoiding paper work).
3. Emote any noun NFT on base by using EAS, reference ERC-6381(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6381). Where this is to make react with selected emojis on any NFT which improves NFT status for every emote user's benefits erc-20 tokens where these tokens used as levels(extra the user may exchange or Mint a NFT like as Noun).
4. RWA with EAS can utilise ERC-4519(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4519): more complecated thing.
5. Build Soul Bound Tokens as certification in Education System by using Base & Zora.

Lastly, the idea is NFT tokenization on Base by using EAS, means Noun/Zora NFT owner interacts with our application to divide NFT upto 100 parts and these NFT can be buied by any user by paying using Base (converting ETH to Base using chainlink oracles!).
